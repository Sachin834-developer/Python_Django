String:
 
Linked List         O(n)                            

sorting of string using sorted(text)  is O(n)  operation 
if you sort two of length n then your Big O is   -->  n log n 

Note:

opt += word1[i] + word2[i] involves string concatenation. In Python, strings are immutable, so each concatenation operation creates a new string. This takes 
O(k) time, where 
𝑘
k is the length of opt so far. As this operation happens 
𝑛
n times, the concatenation operations cumulatively take 
O(n**2).
