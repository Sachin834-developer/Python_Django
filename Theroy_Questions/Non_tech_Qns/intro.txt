I am a Python Developer with 2.5 years of experience specializing in API development using Django Rest Framework. 

I have strong expertise in designing and implementing RESTful APIs, coupled with hands-on experience in frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vue.js. 

I’m proficient in working with SQL databases such as MySQL and PostgreSQL, and I’ve utilized Docker for containerization and Git for version control. 

My experience includes developing scalable applications, integrating third-party services, and optimizing API performance. 

I’m also adept at using tools like Postman for API testing, and I thrive in collaborative, fast-paced environments.


1. Can you describe a challenging API you developed using DRF?
Answer:
"In one project, I developed a payment processing API that required integrating a third-party payment gateway. The challenge was handling asynchronous callbacks for transaction statuses while maintaining idempotency and ensuring secure data handling. I used DRF's serializers for data validation and Django signals to handle post-payment events efficiently. To ensure robustness, I implemented retry mechanisms and extensive test cases, resulting in a highly reliable payment system."

2. How have you optimized the performance of an API?
Answer:
"In a recent project, I optimized an API by implementing query optimizations like select_related and prefetch_related to reduce database hits. Additionally, I introduced pagination to limit large dataset responses and added caching using Redis to minimize redundant database queries. These improvements reduced response times by over 50%."

3. How do you ensure the security of APIs?
Answer:
"I follow security best practices such as implementing OAuth2 for authentication, validating and sanitizing user inputs, and ensuring sensitive data is encrypted. I also set proper CORS policies, use HTTPS, and test for vulnerabilities using tools like OWASP ZAP to prevent attacks like SQL injection or cross-site scripting."

4. Can you discuss a project where you used Vue.js?
Answer:
"In an Event Management System, I used Vue.js to build a dynamic frontend for managing user registrations and events. I utilized Vue's component-based architecture to create reusable UI components and managed state using Vuex. By integrating the frontend with a DRF backend, I ensured seamless communication via REST APIs."

5. Why do you prefer MySQL or PostgreSQL for database management?
Answer:
"I choose the database based on the project requirements. MySQL is excellent for simpler, read-heavy operations due to its speed, while PostgreSQL offers advanced features like JSONB support and transactional integrity, making it ideal for complex data handling. In a recent project, I used PostgreSQL for its ability to handle complex queries and its robust support for data integrity."

6. How do you use Docker in your projects?
Answer:
"I use Docker to containerize applications, ensuring consistency across development and production environments. For example, I created a Dockerfile for my Django application to define dependencies and runtime configurations. This streamlined deployments and made the application portable, allowing it to run seamlessly on any system."

7. How do you manage version control in a team using Git?
Answer:
"I follow a Git workflow, typically GitFlow or feature-branch workflows, depending on the team. I ensure clear commit messages and use pull requests for code reviews. In one project, I also set up CI/CD pipelines that triggered builds and deployments upon merging changes to the main branch, which significantly improved development efficiency."

8. How do you test APIs using Postman?
Answer:
"I use Postman to test APIs by creating collections with structured requests for each endpoint. I automate tests by writing scripts to validate response status codes, payloads, and performance. In a recent project, I used Postman to test edge cases and ensure the API met all functional requirements."

9. Can you describe a project where you worked on full-stack development?
Answer:
"In a full-stack project, I built a sales management system using Django for the backend and Vue.js for the frontend. I designed RESTful APIs for data operations and created an intuitive frontend using Vue components. SQL databases like MySQL handled the data layer, while Docker ensured consistent deployments across environments."

10. What do you do to stay updated with new technologies?
Answer:
"I follow tech blogs, participate in developer communities, and take online courses to stay updated. Recently, I explored fastAPI for lightweight APIs and worked on integrating cloud services like AWS S3 in my projects."
