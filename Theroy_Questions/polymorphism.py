# Overloading: The method name is the same, but the method signature (parameters) is different.
# Overriding: A subclass provides its own implementation for a method inherited from the superclass, typically with the same signature.

"""
Method Overriding: 
    In Python, Polymorphism lets us define methods in the child class that have the same name 
    as the methods in the parent class. In inheritance, the child class inherits the methods 
    from the parent class. However,it is possible to modify a method in a child class that it 
    has inherited from the parent class. 
    This is particularly useful in cases where the method inherited from the parent class 
    doesnâ€™t quite fit the child class.
    In such cases, we re-implement the method in the child class. 
    This process of re-implementing a method in the child class is known as Method Overriding.
