"""
__len__:

__str__: it meant be more of a readable representation of a object, used as a display to
the end user.

__repr__:  repr()  it is an unambigious representation of the object it is used to debugging
,logging , and other purposes ,
 it really meant to be used for the other developers


if we don't define __str__ on an class and if we call str on object its going to 
fallback on the repr method.

# __new__ is typically overridden in cases where you need more control over the object creation process, 
# such as when implementing
# singleton patterns, metaclasses, or when subclassing immutable types like int or str

# Example: When to Override __new__
# Hereâ€™s an example of overriding __new__ to implement a singleton pattern, where only one instance of the class is created:

class Singleton:
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance

    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

obj1 = Singleton(10)
obj2 = Singleton(20)

print(obj1 is obj2)  # True (Both obj1 and obj2 refer to the same instance)
print(obj1.value)    # 20 (Since obj2 modified the value)
# In this example, __new__ ensures that only one instance of the Singleton class is created, 
# and both obj1 and obj2 refer to the same instance.
